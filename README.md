# PizzaLair_9

## Description
In this project our goal was to make a pizza website. It was a challenging but a really fun task.
In our website we have 3 different options to see/order the pizzas, you can look at the menu like you were at a restaurant, then we have an order-page
were you can also see all of our pizzas, if you click on them, you see a long description of each pizza
and their ingredients. Of course on the order-page you can also add the pizzas to the cart. The last  one is a deals page, 
there we have 3 deals: 2 for 1, family deal and pizza of the month. The user can of course also register and log in/out of the website.


## Instructions
We have a requirements.txt file where you can see the requirements needed to run our website :D


## Programming / Database
We used 4 programming languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
We used PostgresSQL for our database and the database is being hosted by google cloud.

## Video
We submitted an awesome video going over the website, so you can see how to use it. The website is really easy
to learn and navigate.
